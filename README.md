# 🧠 Ruby Basics: A Beginner’s Guide

Welcome to **Ruby Basics**, a simple project that walks through fundamental Ruby concepts for beginners. This repository has been created from the Ruby Programming Language - Full Course in order to getting started with Ruby and to understand its syntax, data types, and control structures.

## 📋 Contents

This script covers:

- ✅ Print Types (`puts` vs `print`)
- 🔤 Data Types (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, nil)
- ✍️ String Operations (methods like `.upcase`, `.include?`, `.index`)
- 🔢 Math & Numbers (basic arithmetic, rounding, square root)
- 👤 Getting User Input (`gets.chomp`)
- 🧺 Arrays (creating, accessing, methods like `.length`, `.include?`)
- 🔑 Hashes (key-value pairs)
- 🧱 Methods (defining and returning multiple values)
- 🔀 Conditional Logic (`if`, `elsif`, `else`)
- 🎛 Case Expressions (`case` statements for control flow)
- 🔁 While Loops (`while`)
- 🔂 For Loops (`for`, `.each`, `times`)
- 🧮 Exponent Method (`**`)
- 📖 Reading Files (`File.open`, `.read`, `.readline`, `.readlines`)
- ✍️ Writing Files (append, overwrite, read/write modes)
- ⚠️ Handling Errors (`begin-rescue`, specific exception types)
- 🧩 Classes & Objects (encapsulation, methods, initialization)
- 🧬 Inheritance (subclassing, `super`)
- 🧱 Modules

## 🏗️ Buildings

This section contains simple, hands-on Ruby exercises that apply the fundamentals in fun, practical ways:

- 🔢 **Building a Calculator** – Basic arithmetic operations with user input.
- 😄 **Building a Mad Libs Game** – String interpolation practice using user-provided words.
- ➕ **Building a Better Calculator** – Implements conditional logic to support multiple operations.
- 🎯 **Building a Guessing Game** – A loop-based word guessing game with a limited number of tries.
- 🧮 **Building an Exponent Method** – Manual implementation of power calculation using a loop.
- 📝 **Building a Quiz** – A mini quiz app using classes and objects to store questions and evaluate answers.
